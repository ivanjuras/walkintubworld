      <h3>Security of Your Personal Information</h3>
      <p>
        Walk-In Tub World is committed to protecting the security of your
        personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and
        procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized
        access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal
        information we collect on computer systems with limited access, which
        are located in controlled facilities. When/if we transmit highly
        confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over
        the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the
        Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
      </p>

      <p>
        If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal
        information, it is your responsibility to keep your password
        confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are
        sharing a computer with anyone you should always log out before leaving
        a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent
        users.
